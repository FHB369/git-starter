I need support. Me! The almost 40-year old pregnant woman with the surprise baby on the way and the husband with lung cancer who disappears for hours on end. And I don't know where he goes and he barely even speaks to me anymore. With the moody son who does the same thing, and the overdrawn checking account, and the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty looking crap and, and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet, and we can't even afford to fix it but Oh, I see, now I am supposed to go 'Hank, please what can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the center of attention, cuz God knows, she is the one with the really important problems. 

Somehow, something tells me Hank is here because of you. And I'm not forgetting that. Walt, please, let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit you're in danger! Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family. 

Yes, I do, I have... concerns. If we're going to go down this road and clearly we are for the sake of my brother-in-law. At any rate, I need some assurances that we're going to go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious. You know, I'm a bookkeeper so I know what money laundering is. And uh... as with most things, the devil is in the details. So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money? 

That's, um... gosh, that's uh, wow. How is that even possible? Huh! I guess so. Um... is that yours, outside? Yeah, right. So the... IRS stuff - that's resolved? So you paid them? When? There will never be a better deal, Ted. The deal is, you pay your back taxes, you pay your penalty and you don't go to prison. That's a good deal. So, let's keep our priorities straight here, right?
