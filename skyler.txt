I would greatly appreciate it if you would just, help me out here. Um, he's fine. No, absolutely not and I mean to keep it that way, so. Six-hundred and seventeen thousand dollars written out to me. Uh... what is this? Well, and why is that? It feels wrong. Uh huh. Well, um... Ted, the whole reason we're in this mess is because you had me cooking your books. So, when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you? 

No, Ted, this is the big mistake right here. You owe the federal government six-hundred and seventeen thousand dollars. If you do not pay them, they will come after you, and then they will come after me. And if they audit my business, find out that Walt and I paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings. We will go to prison, where you will already be. Do you understand? Oh my god, how are you not following me here? 

Then you don't owe them. So, if I'm... understanding you correctly, you're saying you can't take the money I gave you, but you can take a larger amount. Because it's not enough? Ted, are you blackmailing me? I think you're explaining it fine. I notice that uh... this is for less than what I gave you, by the way. And now that you know that you will of course be returning it? I don't want you to pay me, Ted. I want you to pay them. Try it again. Write a new check. Same amount, only this time, made payable, make it payable to the Internal Revenue Service. You have to. WRITE. IT. 

A tiara... a white gold tiara for a newborn baby. Yeah... you know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill. I mean that thing must have cost like what... five or six hundred dollars? I think I'm going to return it. Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a diaper genie more than a white gold baby tiara.
